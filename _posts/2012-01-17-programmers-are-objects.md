This is a disturbing thread from my email (names have been changed to protect the innocent):

> **From: John Smith
  
> To: Dan**
> 
> Dan,
  
> I got your email from your blog, linked from the Toronto Java Users Group.
  
> Wondering if you or any of your friends / contacts may be interested in
  
> Java Developer opportunities in downtown Toronto? 
> 
> Do you have any contacts you could send my way or forward this email to? 
> 
> Thank you,
  
> John Smith
  
> 416-555-1212 

My very snarky, sarcastic reply:

> **From: Dan
  
> To: John Smith**
> 
> If I sell you my friends, do I get a cut of your commission? 

John seemed to miss my snark and replied with a serious reply:

> **From: John Smith
  
> To: Dan**
> 
> Dan,
> 
> I&#8217;m definitively open to that. 
> 
> Just to be completely honest and open you should know, I&#8217;m only starting out and am a sourcer for another Recruiter. Which means I&#8217;ll get about $400 for a successful placement that the Recruiter gets $5000 for.
> 
> But of course, out of my $400, you can get a piece, and hopefully in time when I become a full-fledged Recruiter our relationship will continue to produce.
