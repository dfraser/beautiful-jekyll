I have been falling asleep to YouTube lately. It&#8217;s a good distraction. Here are some of my favourite content creators. They put amazing amounts of effort into making entertaining and educational videos. You should check them all out.

[Matthias Wandel](http://www.youtube.com/user/Matthiaswandel), an amazing woodworker who was an engineer at RIM in a previous life. He&#8217;s stopped by [the lab](http://hacklab.to) a couple of times.

[Keith Fenner](http://www.youtube.com/user/KEF791), a machine shop operator in Cape Cod

[EEVBlog](http://www.youtube.com/user/EEVblog), no more needs to be said

[Mike&#8217;s Electric Stuff](http://www.youtube.com/user/mikeselectricstuff), for when Dave Jones drives you crazy and you want something chill

[Ben Krasnow](http://www.youtube.com/user/bkraz333), because DIY xray tomography
