The Toronto Java Users Group is back for its fourth great year. Things are going well, we have a nice steady group of regulars. We still meet at the Free Times Cafe, and the meetings have a nice social aspect. Presentations are short and sweet, and we try to avoid blatant product pitches.

If you&#8217;re into Java, and you&#8217;re in the GTA, you should totally join us. Third Thursday of each month, Free Times Cafe, 7pm start.
