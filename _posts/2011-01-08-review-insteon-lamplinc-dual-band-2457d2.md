I am extremely disappointed with this product. It has serious design and quality flaws.

I&#8217;ve been investigating putting some Insteon devices in my house to control my lights and appliances, so I ordered a few samples. I ordered a wire-in dimmer (2876DB), a 2-wire wire-in dimmer kit (2474D), a powerline modem/computer interface (2413U) and the above-mentioned plug-in lamp module.

My first hint of the quality problems with this lamp module came when I first plugged a lamp into it. The plug just didn&#8217;t fit right. It seemed to bottom out long before it was completely inserted. Complete insertion was possible with a bit of wiggling and force, but then the plug didn&#8217;t make a proper connection. The plug only connected properly when it was inserted about 2/3 of the way, which is not a safe condition.

I took the device apart to investigate (luckily this was easy &#8212; just remove four screws on the back). I was quite surprised by what I found! The reason the plug didn&#8217;t fit was clear &#8212; the screws holding the contacts to the device&#8217;s case were interfering with the plug! Check it out:

This is a totally puzzling design flaw. Didn&#8217;t they ever try actually inserting a plug? How could this product even get past a prototype stage? It&#8217;s possible that my unit is defective or built incorrectly, but I don&#8217;t see any other way it could be put together.

When I showed it to my friend Andrew, he noticed another critical flaw. The aluminum heatsink for the dimmer triac inside could touch one or both output terminals, causing a short circuit. This could easily happen if the device was dropped or shaken when powered on, and it would definitely cause the device to be destroyed. I got out a multimeter and tested it, putting one probe on the output terminal and the other on the heat sink, and a slight press on the heat sink caused a short circuit. Take a look:

I added a small piece of high-temperature Kapton tape to the underside of the heat sink so I could feel better about this device and reassembled it. I&#8217;ll probably use it, but I certainly won&#8217;t buy another one. It&#8217;s total junk. For $50, I didn&#8217;t expect excellent quality, but I at least expected to get something safe and reliable.

Hopefully my other Insteon devices will be better.
