I&#8217;m an avid user of car sharing in Toronto. I live downtown in a tiny cliff home, I don&#8217;t have access to free parking, and I don&#8217;t have a car of my own. I&#8217;ve done the math a million times, and as much as I&#8217;d love to own my own car, it really is too expensive. It breaks down a bit like this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Monthly Car Payment
    </td>
    
    <td>
      $200 (for a Honda Fit or similar)
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      Monthly Parking
    </td>
    
    <td>
      $200
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      Monthly Insurance
    </td>
    
    <td>
      $150
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      Monthly Gas & Maintenance Fund
    </td>
    
    <td>
      $100
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <b>Monthly Total</b>
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <b>$650</b>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

As you can see, even with cost-cutting and getting a great deal on a car and insurance, it&#8217;s still expensive to own a car downtown. Here are some of the things I like to use a car for:

  * Visiting the RC Heli Field
  * Shopping for Groceries
  * Shopping for Home Maintenance Supplies
  * Cruising around, looking at the sights
  * Going to nice events without using gross cabs or TTC

Toronto has some alternatives to cars. There is acceptable public transit and you can usually get a taxi by waving. For many tasks and leisure activities, though, both of those options are awkward. It&#8217;s annoying for both you and the other passengers to carry any amount of cargo on the TTC, and Toronto taxis can be a harrowing experience. You can get a crazy, sleep-deprived driver, a disgusting or broken vehicle, and an expectation of a significant tip on top of an already expensive ride. That&#8217;s not to say I don&#8217;t regularly use taxis or the TTC, just that there is a need for a more elegant transportation solution.

Toronto has three major car sharing services. They are AutoShare, ZipCar, and Car2Go. Each one has its own advantages and disadvantages, and I will try to summarize my feelings about them in this article. Since I have only personally used Car2Go and ZipCar, I will ignore AutoShare in this article. If you&#8217;re an AutoShare user and would like to weigh in, there is a comment button below!

I&#8217;ll cover each of ZipCar and Car2Go each in their own entry and link them here.
