I&#8217;ve been replacing Eyeo&#8217;s AdBlock Plus with Ghostery in all my browsers. Eyeo is a strange and secretive company who makes money on allowing ads through their blocker &#8212; not my cup of tea. Sure, they recently opened up the decisions of what to allow through to an &#8220;independent&#8221; board, but the bottom line is that they make money off showing you ads & disrespecting your privacy. Nah.

I replaced with Ghostery. It&#8217;s not quite as good as a pure ad blocker but it seems to have a good heart. It can optionally send them data but it asks you first (I said no) and it seems to be well-respected in the community. And they don&#8217;t let companies pay to bypass.

You have to be VERY careful with browser extensions these days. They can compromise your privacy and your security in serious ways&#8230; make sure the ones you install are authentic and well-researched. And turn off and delete any ones you don&#8217;t need. It&#8217;s good to do an audit once in a while.

My list:

  * evernote web clipper
  * 1password
  * ghostery

That&#8217;s it.

Hope this wasn&#8217;t too boring, I thought I&#8217;d share what was on my mind.
